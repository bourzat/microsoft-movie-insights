We will be examining variuos datasets from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) and [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) - we'll be trying to identify Box Office trends and impactful movie performance metrics. This analysis will mainly be focused on what type of films are highly successful and in turn translating these findigs into actionable recommendations for Microsoft's film production strategy."

    "In today's highly competitive entertainment industry, where companies continously aim to create captivating content while simultaneously giving high financial returns. Microsoft has been inspired by the success of other major companies - such as Amazon - to create original films and plans to establish their own new movie studio. However, entering the film production industry poses a significant challenge since it requires a comprehensive understanding of movies that not only ressonate with majority of audience around the world but also do well financially. \n",

    "    * `IMDB` is a reputable extensive database for movies, TV shows and celebrities. It has been offering detailed information for over 3 decades and remains an authority in the movie space. The `im.db` file is an SQL database containing information about movies, cast and more that are essential to determine various factors which contribute to a movie's success in this project.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)\n",
    "    * `Box Office Mojo` is a website that tracks revenue generated by Box Office movies and provides detailed statistics about them. It is majorly used to analyze and track the financial success of film. Our `bom.movie_gross.csv` file will provide critical information that will help access the financial performance of films. This will help the new studio head, company executives and investors to determine what type of films to invest in.\n",

    "    * `Rotten Tomatoes` is a popular movie site that collects and aggregates reviews from movie critics and audiences. It provides a score known as the \"Tomatometer\" which reflects the overall success of films. Both the `rt.reviews.tsv` and the `rt.movie_info.tsv` file will be used to determine the audience opinion and satisfaction on various types of films. This will help in identifying patterns in what types of movies are well-rated by the audience and tailor production towards that direction.\n",
